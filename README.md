# Overview
This is a simple rails blog I am creating for Ship it! Saturday. It features a
responsive hexagonal grid, where each hexagon will link to a blog post. It is
currently just a mockup with limited functionality, but will eventually have
all the features you would expect from a blogging platform such as Word Press.
